## Overview

It was time to get a better understanding of grid and flex. The "News homepage" was a real challenge regarding that. But in the end I got much more out of it.

### The challenge

For me the most challenging were the nested grids. I found a good solution using '@container queries' beside '@media queries'. This is especially helpful if not the layout but only a specific container has to change.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I improved my workflow by building the layout first. When this was working, only then I started to add the content.
- I finally started to understand clamp() and its power, especially to handle font sizing.
- For so long @container queries were a black box for me, but here I practised it for the first time.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
